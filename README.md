## Abstract

This project presents a formal mathematical framework for an AI agent designed for continuous navigation in structured environments for automated theorem solving. The agent leverages a combination of ontologies, Bayesian updating, Kalman filters, large language models (LLMs), token-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT). A Coq proof assistant is integrated within a Docker environment for computational verification of HoTT-based hypotheses, ensuring robust and verifiable reasoning.

## 1. Introduction

This work introduces a framework that integrates diverse mathematical and computational methods. The agent operates in a 2D continuous space, using structured knowledge (ontologies) along with probabilistic and formal verification techniques to navigate and make decisions.

### Motivation

Traditional navigation algorithms often lack deep reasoning and formal verification. By combining advanced mathematical theories and probabilistic models, this framework enhances decision-making and ensures correctness.

### Contributions

- **Ontology Integration:** Uses directed graphs to represent and navigate knowledge structures.
- **Probabilistic Inference:** Applies Bayesian updating and Kalman filters to maintain belief states.
- **Decision-Making:** Uses token-aware MCTS to balance exploration and exploitation within token limits.
- **Verification:** Employs LLMs to generate reasoning traces and HoTT via Coq for formal verification.
- **System Integration:** Details a Docker-based setup for seamless interaction among components.

## 2. Universal Notation

To maintain clarity, we use the following notation:

- **Scalars:** Lowercase letters (a, b, c in R)
- **Vectors:** Bold lowercase letters (v, w in R^n)
- **Matrices:** Uppercase letters (A, B in R^(n x m))
- **Random Variables:** Uppercase letters (X, Y)
- **Probability Distributions:** "N(mean, covariance)" denotes a Gaussian distribution.
- **Expectation:** E[·]
- **State, Action, and Observation Spaces:** S, A, and O respectively.
- **Belief State:** b_t represents the belief at time t.
- **Time Index:** t is a discrete time step.

---

## 3. Ontology

The ontology is modeled as a directed graph where:
- **Nodes (V):** Represent concepts, types, theorems, etc.
- **Edges (E):** Represent relationships like "contains", "depends on", or "references".

### Structure

- **Universes:** Hierarchical levels of types (U1, U2, …)
- **Types and Terms:** Types map between universes; terms are elements of these types.
- **Theorems & HITs:** Nodes include propositions and higher inductive types.
- **Meta-Mathematical Concepts:** Nodes include ideas like Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems.

### Navigation Actions

The agent can:
- **MoveTo(node):** Transition to a new node if an edge exists.
- **Inspect(node):** Retrieve information about a node.

---

## 4. Environment

The agent navigates a 2D Euclidean space with obstacles and a target goal.

- **State:** Agent’s position (s_t in R^2)
- **Actions:** Acceleration vectors (a_t in R^2)
- **Dynamics:** Governed by discrete-time kinematics with noise.
- **Observations:** Noisy measurements of the agent’s position.
- **Goal and Obstacles:** Defined target position and circular obstacles.

---

## 5. Agent Definition

The agent maintains internal models and interacts with the ontology. It updates its beliefs and selects actions to reach its goal.

- **Belief State:** Represents uncertainty about the environment and hypotheses.
- **Available Actions:** A discrete set of acceleration vectors.
- **Observation Encoding:** Maps raw observations into a latent space.
- **Ontology Integration:** Uses actions like MoveTo and Inspect to access knowledge.

---

## 6. Bayesian Inference and Kalman Filters

These methods update the agent’s belief state based on observations:

- **Bayesian Update:** Combines prior beliefs with new evidence.
- **Kalman Filter:** Provides a recursive solution under linear Gaussian assumptions with separate prediction and update steps.

---

## 7. Hypotheses and Prior Distribution

The agent considers multiple hypotheses about its environment and updates them using Bayesian methods:
- **Uniform Prior:** Initially, all hypotheses are equally likely.
- **Likelihood and Posterior Update:** Calculated from new observations.

---

## 8. Probabilistic World Model

This model predicts future states and observations:
- **Transition Model:** Describes how the state evolves given an action.
- **Observation Model:** Describes how observations are generated from states.
- **Implementation:** Encapsulated in a modular class structure.

---

## 9. Large Language Model (LLM)

The LLM generates reasoning traces and Coq code for verification.

- **Architecture:** Based on the Transformer model.
- **Reasoning Traces:** Sequences of structured steps for decision making.
- **Token Budget:** Ensures computations stay within resource limits.

---

## 10. Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) and Coq Verification

HoTT provides the foundation for formal reasoning. The Coq proof assistant, run inside Docker, is used to verify proofs generated by the agent.

- **Key Concepts:** Types as spaces, paths as equalities, and higher inductive types.
- **Univalence Axiom:** States that equivalent types are equal.
- **Verification Workflow:** Involves generating Coq code, uploading to a container, and executing proofs.

---

## 11. Token-Aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

A modified MCTS that accounts for token consumption during planning:

- **Tree Structure:** Each node stores state, token budget, visit count, and total reward.
- **Selection Policy:** Uses an adjusted UCB formula that penalizes high token usage.
- **Expansion, Simulation, and Backpropagation:** Follow standard MCTS with token-aware modifications.

---

## 12. Implementation Details

### Observation Encoder
- Uses a feedforward neural network to map 2D observations to a 32-dimensional vector.

### Reward Function
- Combines environmental rewards, token penalties, exploration bonuses, and reasoning quality.

### LLM-TAC Wrapper
- Manages prompt generation, caches responses, and enforces rate limits.

### Docker Environment
- Encapsulates the Coq environment for consistent verification and execution.

## 13. Agent Workflow

1. **Observation Acquisition:** Receive a noisy observation.
2. **Belief Update:** Update using Bayesian inference and Kalman filters.
3. **Reasoning Generation:** LLM produces a reasoning trace.
4. **Coq Verification:** Reasoning is verified in the Dockerized Coq environment.
5. **MCTS Action Selection:** Choose the next action considering token constraints.
6. **Action Execution:** Perform the selected action.
7. **Reward Reception:** Update reward based on action outcome.
